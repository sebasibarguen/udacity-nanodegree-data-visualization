This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
url = url("http://data.githubarchive.org/2014-11-01-12.json.gz")
N = 15743

github = data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow=N, ncol=13), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)


```
